Bare Metal Programming Tool Kit TH04 examples directory

This part of the tree contains example (complete) and skeleton (incomplete)
code that is used in the microcontroller course I give at the 
Hogeschool Utrecht, the Netherlands.
All code uses the DB013 board, which contains an LPC1114 chip.


This directory contains :
   Makefile : supports 'clean' and 'build' targets
   README   : this file

subdirectories - week 1 :
   blink    : blink a LED
   switch   : copy switch to LED

subdirectories - week 2 :
   440hz     : use timer to beep at an accurate 440 Hz 
   timer     : idem, but timer code in separate .c/.h files
   servo     : hobby-servo example code
   sw-uart   : use timer to send asych to the PC
   ds1990    : skeleton (incomplete) code to show a DS1990 ID
   
subdirectories - week 3 :
   no example code for this week

subdirectories - week 4 :
   i2c       : i2c library (not a complete application)

subdirectories - week 5 :
   lpc810    : LPC810 blink-a-led example

subdirectories - week 6 :
